## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get the project running locally for development and testing.

---

### üì¶ 2. Install Dependencies, Set Up Database, Configure Environment

1. **Install all required project dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set Up the Vercel KV Database:**

   This project uses **Vercel KV** for storing configuration data securely.

   ```bash
   npx vercel link
   ```

   Follow the prompts to link your local project to your Vercel account and select the `observability_copilot` project.

   Then, create a KV store:

   ```bash
   npx vercel kv create
   ```

   Follow the prompts to name the store (e.g., `observability-kv`) and select a region.

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   After the KV store is created, Vercel will automatically add the necessary environment variables to a `.env.local` file.

   You need to manually add your **Gemini API key**.

   ```env
   # .env.local

   REDIS_URL=""
   VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN=""

   # Add your Gemini API Key
   GEMINI_API_KEY="AIza..."  # Replace with your actual API key
   ```
